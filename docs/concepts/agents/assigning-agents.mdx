title: Assigning Agents to Tasks
sidebarTitle: Task Assignment
---

To assign an agent to a task, use the `agents` parameter when creating a task. Each task requires at least one assigned agent, and will use a default agent if none are provided. Agents can be assigned to multiple tasks, and tasks can have multiple agents. 

### Tasks with one agent

To assign a single agent to a task, create the task and pass the agent to the `agents` parameter:

```python
import controlflow as cf

poet = cf.Agent(name="Poet")

poem = cf.run("Write a short poem about AI", agents=[poet])
```

Alternatively, you can use the agent's own `run` method:

```python
import controlflow as cf

poet = cf.Agent(name="Poet")

poem = poet.run("Write a short poem about AI")
```

These two approaches are functionally equivalent.


### Tasks with multiple agents

Assign multiple agents to a task by passing them to the task's `agents` parameter as a list.

Here, we create two agents and assign them to a task that has them debate each other.

```python Code
import controlflow as cf

optimist = cf.Agent(
    name="Optimist",
    instructions="Always find the best in every situation.",
)

pessimist = cf.Agent(
    name="Pessimist",
    instructions="Always find the worst in every situation.",
)

cf.run(
    "Debate world peace",
    agents=[optimist, pessimist],
    instructions=(
        "Mark the task successful once both agents have "
        "found something to agree on."
    )
)
```
```text Result
Optimist: I see where you're coming from, Pessimist. Human nature and the
disparities among nations do present significant challenges to achieving world
peace. However, it's important to focus on the positive aspects and the
potential for improvement.

Pessimist: While it's true that efforts towards peace can lead to some positive
outcomes, the reality is that these efforts are often met with setbacks,
failures, and unintended consequences. The end of apartheid and the fall of the
Berlin Wall were monumental achievements, but they didn't come without immense
struggle, loss, and suffering. Moreover, the aftermath of such events often
leaves lingering issues that take decades to resolve, if they ever are.

Optimist: For instance, while human nature has its flaws, it also has incredible
capacity for compassion, cooperation, and progress. These positive traits have
led to remarkable achievements in history, such as the end of apartheid, the
fall of the Berlin Wall, and advancements in human rights.

Pessimist: International cooperation through organizations like the United
Nations is often hampered by bureaucracy, political agendas, and lack of
enforcement power. Peace treaties can be fragile and easily broken, leading to
renewed conflicts that sometimes are even worse than before.

Optimist: Additionally, efforts like international cooperation through
organizations such as the United Nations and various peace treaties show that
despite differences, nations can come together for a common good. While world
peace may be difficult to achieve, the journey towards it can foster greater
understanding, reduce conflicts, and improve the quality of life for many
people.

Pessimist: So, while there might be some value in striving for peace, the harsh
truth is that the road is fraught with difficulties that may never be fully
overcome. In essence, the pursuit of world peace often feels like an endless,
Sisyphean task.

Optimist: Can we agree that, even though world peace is challenging, the efforts
and progress made towards it are valuable and can lead to significant positive
outcomes?

Pessimist: I suppose we can reluctantly agree that efforts towards peace might
lead to some temporary positive outcomes, but the overall picture remains bleak
and discouraging.

---

Result: Both agents agreed that efforts towards world peace can lead to some
temporary positive outcomes, despite the overall bleak and discouraging reality.
