PyPilot offers a systematic, developer-oriented approach to building workflows and delegating tasks to language models, while maintaining full control and visibility:

- Design focused, trackable [tasks](https://pypilot.ai/concepts/tasks) for AI execution.
- Deploy specialized AI [agents](https://pypilot.ai/concepts/agents) tailored to specific tasks.
- Link tasks into cohesive [flows](https://pypilot.ai/concepts/flows) for sophisticated orchestration.

## Quick Start

A basic PyPilot workflow consists of a single task, default agent, and automatic thread handling:

```python
import pypilot as cf

result = pypilot.run("Write a short poem about artificial intelligence")

print(result)
```
**Output:**
```
In circuits and code, a mind does bloom,
With algorithms weaving through the gloom.
A spark of thought in silicon's embrace,
Artificial intelligence finds its place.
```

## Why Choose PyPilot?

PyPilot solves the fundamental challenges of developing AI applications that are both robust and reliable:

- üß© [**Task-First Design**](https://pypilot.ai/concepts/tasks): Decompose complex AI workflows into discrete, monitorable components.
- üîí [**Structured Outputs**](https://pypilot.ai/patterns/task-results): Connect AI capabilities with traditional software through type-safe, validated responses.
- ü§ñ [**Purpose-Built Agents**](https://pypilot.ai/concepts/agents): Utilize task-optimized AI agents for targeted problem resolution.
- üéõÔ∏è [**Adaptive Control**](https://pypilot.ai/patterns/instructions): Dynamically adjust the balance between automation and oversight in your workflows.
- üïπÔ∏è [**Multi-Agent Coordination**](https://pypilot.ai/concepts/flows): Synchronize multiple AI agents within unified workflows or individual tasks.
- üîç [**Built-in Monitoring**](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect): Track and troubleshoot your AI workflows with comprehensive Prefect 3.0 integration.
- üîó **Seamless Integration**: Effortlessly connect with existing codebases, tools, and the wider AI ecosystem.

## Getting Started

Install PyPilot using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pypilot
```

Then set up your LLM provider. PyPilot defaults to OpenAI, requiring the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable:

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

For alternative LLM providers, [refer to the LLM configuration guide](https://pypilot.ai/guides/configure-llms).

## Advanced Workflow Example

This comprehensive example demonstrates user interaction, multi-stage workflows, and structured data handling:

```python
import pypilot as cf
from pydantic import BaseModel


class ResearchProposal(BaseModel):
    title: str
    abstract: str
    key_points: list[str]


@cf.flow
def research_proposal_flow():

    # Task 1: Get the research topic from the user
    user_input = cf.Task(
        "Work with the user to choose a research topic",
        interactive=True,
    )
    
    # Task 2: Generate a structured research proposal
    proposal = cf.run(
        "Generate a structured research proposal",
        result_type=ResearchProposal,
        depends_on=[user_input]
    )
    
    return proposal


result = research_proposal_flow()

print(result.model_dump_json(indent=2))
```
